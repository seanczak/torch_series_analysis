    "Explain autoencoder use\n",
    "\n",
    "figure 1: consider 1d series...show that first of target isn't in future (needs to be shifted back to be causal) and because of that last of input doesn't have a future prediction (draw line to show where to lop off both series and note that it's \"1\" value at the moment)\n",
    "\n",
    "in convolution, you actually need to provide some padding to only the front (which we'll show you how to do) to make sure you are causal, it's dependent on the receptive field of the model which is dependent on the dilation and kernel size (equation)\n",
    "\n",
    "figure 2: show some greyed out zeros on the image above and preds are now added (maybe a single kernel grabbing inputs and pointing to pred it creates)\n",
    "\n",
    "NOte that because of this, you might want to add a little priming during training before you start scoring the results (cut off the ones that were influenced by padding if you so choose, this will be easy to do though because both the targets and the preds would be the same amount to cut off - \"padding\" below)\n",
    "\n",
    "Now remember as we do this that this can easily be extended to multivariate (multi-channel) data and of course pytorch can handle batches as well. so as we do this with one example, just realize the the blocks could extend into the page like so... (just don't feel like drawing it)...theoretically the channels in are the same amount as the channels out but technically you could only want say 1 out channel for 5 in channels but of course for an autoencoder that doesn't work the other way around (although if you did have a target that was different than the input the logic in this article should help you think through the indexing of that as well)\n",
    "\n",
    "figure 3: show that the channels extend into board (maybe add another one)\n",
    "\n",
    "we may want to guess farther into future (say next month if these are values taken weekly), so let's see what that does to the image below\n",
    "\n",
    "figure 4: modify fig 2 show guessing 5? into the future (again with the lines and showing how much to lop off begin/end of respective series), greyed out bits that aren't used, note that inputs no longer have targets at the end because they got shifted, note that predictions don't need to be modified (as you cut the input len, predictions follow)\n",
    "\n",
    "or you may want to predict each week for the next 4 weeks\n",
    "\n",
    "figure 5: same as fig 2 but now outputs have been stacked\n",
    "\n",
    "or you may want to combine these (either to make it harder or because you have an actual use age for the information)\n",
    "\n",
    "figure 6: both fig 4 and 5\n",
    "\n",
    "finally a limited use case I imagine but just in case it comes up, covering bases, what if you strided your kernel. well this is basically just subsampling the outputs which means that with no modification of your input series, your preds will have fewer values so you need to also remove the corresponding values from the targets array\n",
    "\n",
    "figure 7: show stride 2 and 3 on both of the above (or just one example and say trust me it works the same for figures 2,4,5,6 equally)\n",
    "\n",
    "ok so using this reshaping logic, you should have the necessary framework to start reshaping/indexing properly to create a causal autoencoder... now I'm going to show you how this works in pytorch. Going to be laborious about the indexing because it's really important to know how to access things when you're training/rebuilding/adding-to/evaluating a model\n",

    "While the expected dimensions of `torch.nn.Conv1d` are `batch_size, out_channels, seq_len`, the dimensions of the above correspond with `batch_size, out_channels, seq_len, out_timesteps` (so `[:,:,1:]` still cuts the first value of the sequence forcing the model to guess \"next\" not the current state). For example, starting with [0,5] and padding, we want the first output of channel 1 to be [10, 20, 30] (it's contribution was the 0) and the output of channel 2 to be [15, 25, 35] (it's contribution was the 5). Notice instead of `Tin - 1` like before, how output sequence is of length `Tin - p` (where T is seq_len of input and p is number of expected output timesteps at each step).  Thus, we might as well not even feed in the last p of the input sequence examples into the model because they cannot be scored.\n",

    "Ahh the simplicity of PyTorch.  All we needed to do was pass our input data in as an argument to the model we created and it generates the output series based on the weights stored (or optimized as that may be the case).  But you may notice that there are only 11 values in the output series whereas our original dataset had 15.  Recall that we are taking a moving average of 5 data points which means that, in order to make an inference at a particular point in time, we need to know the previous 4 values.  Thus, our first output can only come once we have \"seen\" 5 data points. The figure provides a visual of how a 1d convolutional kernel slides along the time axis of our input series to provide a single output value at every timestep after skipping the first 4.  Again, PyTorch handles all of this logic internally for us but understanding the expected dimensional output is still very important for model scoring, prototyping, etc."
